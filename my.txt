Hello my name is sajal soni. currently i'm trying to find a job. so this is my attempt to learn git hub. although i have been trying to learn this things for past two years but honestly eveytime i find myself with low energy and zero motivation.
So this is also one attempt to be successful.
Successful means, i want to achive my learning goals. by no means i meant to get a job by leaning this.
